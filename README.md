# ProjectBlackhole
### A web application that can store anything! (if you are brave enough...)

This project aims to create a simple and minimal yet complete web application that can manipulate generic objects arranged in a graph-like structure inside a database.

The main goal of this project is to explore and gain knowledge on all the components and mechanisms of such systems on a lower level,
with everything else coming second. The challenge is to make the app as minimal as possible without using any framework by doing alot of the things by hand.

### Status
I just started, so it's basically empty
