# ProjectBlackhole
### A web application that can store anything! (if you are brave enough...)

This project aims to create a simple and minimal yet complete web application that can manipulate generic objects arranged in a graph-like structure inside a relational database.

The main goal is to explore and gain knowledge on all the components and mechanisms of web based systems on a lower level,
with everything else coming second. The challenge is to make the app as minimal as possible without using any framework by doing alot of the things by hand.

### Status
The project is still in very early development and is in a non functional state at the moment.
